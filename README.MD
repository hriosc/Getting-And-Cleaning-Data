Open the run_analysis.R then set working directory to source file location
The script will download and unzip the folder with data

The script will take the use trough the five step to create tidy data.
Step 1.- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Step 2.- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Step 3.- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Step 4.- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The file run_analysis.R = Run all the steps described in order

The file CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data

The output is the file tidy_data.txt
